Planning Poker
==============

**The repository has been moved to bitbucket: [planning-poker](https://bitbucket.org/ekzhu/planning-poker)**

All future development work will happen there.

Get Started
-----------

To get started, you need to download and install [Meteor](http://meteor.com). Type the following in terminal. 

    $ curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

If you are using Windows, try [Meteor for Windows](http://win.meteor.com).

Once you have meteor, go into the repository directory, and run:

    $ meteor run
    
A local version of the app should be running at localhost:3000.
